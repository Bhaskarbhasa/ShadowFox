This allows me to answer questions, provide information, and even engage in creative activities like storytelling or humor.\n\nI'm designed to be helpful and informative, but I'm not perfect. I may make mistakes or struggle with certain topics. However, I'm constantly learning and improving through user interactions and feedback.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything, from science and history to entertainment and culture. I'll do my best to provide accurate and engaging responses!"

If no such window exists, return an empty string.\n\nExample:\n- `s = \"ADOBECODEBANC\"`\n- `t = \"ABC\"`\n\nExpected output: `\"BANC\"` (the minimum window containing all characters of `t`)\n\n**Problem 2: Max Area of Island**\n\nGiven a grid of integers `grid`, where each cell represents the height of an island, find the maximum area of an island in the grid. An island is a group of connected cells with the same height.\n\nExample:\n- `grid = [[0,0,1,0],[0,2,1,0],[0,1,1,0]]`\n\nExpected output: `4` (the maximum area of an island)\n\nTake your time to think about these problems and try to come up with a solution.
